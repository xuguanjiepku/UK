Thank you for visiting.

In this project, I built an interactive R-Shiny app to visualize the statistical analysis of 1.6M road traffic accidents
in the UK.
This R-Shiny app revealed hourly, daily, and geographic patterns,which could be utilized to improve the efficiency of a road 
traffic monitoring system and to guide police patrolling.
